## Kernel Description

### Rhino RTOS Kernel

---

Rhino is in-house designed and developed RTOS kernel by AliOS Things team. Rhino provides ultra-small footprint, low power, priority-based/preemptive scheduling, Round-Robin scheduling, multitasking.

Rhino provides rich kernel primitives including buffer queue, ring buffer, timer, semaphore, mutex, fifo, event etc.

#### Small footprint

Rhino supportsboth static and dynamic allocation for most of the kernel objects. A memoryallocator designed for small memory block management, can support both fixedblock and variable block, multiple memory region.

Most of the kernelfeatures including workqueue, memory allocator and so on could be configurable inor out by per-build file named k_config.h. 

With the ability to scale component in and out, rhino could make the very small size of final image, which could be programmed into device which has very same flash size.

#### Low power

For the IOT device, itâ€™s very important to consider the power consumption for hardware because the buffer of power is limited, the system consume the power faster the live time of system is shorter. Rhino kernel provides tickles idle mode of CPU to help system to save the power and extend the live time of system.

Normally, When CPU has nothing to do, CPU will execute a native instruction of the processor (WFI for ARM, HLT for IA32-bit processors) to enter a low power state, the CPU register context is maintained,and system tick clock interrupts wakes up the CPU at every tick moment.

To save more power than the normal way, rhino kernel provides tickles idle mode of CPU. When OS detect there is nothing to do in feature with a fixed duration (multiple ticks or more long), we call this fixed duration as tickles idle time, and the system tick clock is programmed to fire interrupt with tickles idle time and put CPU into C1 state(CPU execute a native instruction, WFI for ARM, HLT for IA 32-bit processors), from that point there is no system tick clock interrupt happen anymore and the system tick count stop to increase and CPU is in low power mode(C1) until tickless idle time passed and the system tick timer interrupt is fired again to wakeup CPU from C1 to C0 state, and passed ticks is compensated to system tick count.

#### Real time

Rhino provides two scheduling policy, priority-based/preemptive scheduling and round-robin scheduling. For both scheduling policy, the highest priority task is always preferred for scheduling.

A priority-based preemptive scheduler preempts the CPU when a task has a higher priority than the current task running. Thus, the kernel ensures that the CPU is always allocated to the highest priority task that is ready to run. This means that if a task with a higher priority than that of the current task becomes ready to run, the kernel immediately saves the current task's context, and switches to the context of the higher priority task.

A round-robin scheduler is going to share the CPU amongst these tasks by using time-slicing. Each task in a group of tasks with the same priority executes for a defined interval, or time slice, before relinquishing the CPU to the next task in the group. No one of them, therefore, can usurp the processor until it is blocked. When the time slice expires, the task moves to last place in the ready queue list for that priority.

#### Debug features

Rhino can support stack overflow, memory leak, memory corruption detection which help developer figure out root cause of difficult issues. Cooperating with AliOS Studio IDE, Rhino's trace function help visualize overall system activities.

### Yloop event framework

---

Yloop is an asynchronous event framework, highly considering [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) and event loop used in Embedded world. Yloop provide a mechanism to handle IO(mainly socket), timer, system events, user events in a single task which greatly reduce memory usage while avoid the complexity of multi-threading programming.

Yloop instance is bound to task context, multiple Yloop instances can be created, each bound to a single task, so that more performance can be achieved in powerful hardware.

### KV

---

Designed for flash especially NOR Flash:

- much less erase times to extend flash life
- power safe, no middle-state status will exist
- key-value friendly usage, value supports binary format data
- minimum supported flash size is 8KB

## Protocol Stack Description

uData is a especial software framework for IoT smart service based on kinds of sensors,and has a general name as Sensor Hub traditionally. 

There are two parts in the uData Framework, one is in the framework layer including uData service manager, service algo, abstact model(abs), the other is in the kernel layer providing the sensor driver SDK. 

The target scope of uData service will focus on the IoT business like drone toy, smart street lamp, sweeper robot and so on. The sensor drivers not only provide the sensor SDK, but also provide the knids of sensor drivers like ALS, Barometer,temperature, accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer etc.

### IoT Protocols

---

AliOS Things supports rich cloud connection protocols:

- Alink: Alibaba Cloud Link platform, suitable for Smart Life. WiFi Provisioning component YWSS is also included.
