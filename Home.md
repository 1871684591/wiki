AliOS released by Alibaba is an open-source implementation of operating system (OS) for Internet of Things (IoT). Alibaba has released AliOS to make the IoT technology used in Alibaba more broadly available to developers, in order to accelerate the development of products for the better IoT world.

### Features and benefits of AliOS

**Open Source**
Released under an Apache 2.0 licence, Developers can use AliOS in commercial and personal projects with confidence.

**Highly Portable**
With a very narrow platform abstraction layer and modular design, Developers can port with a really short time.

**Seamless Connected**
With built-in mesh capability (known as uMesh), Developers not only get one isolated device, but a connected world.

**Flexible**
With the asynchronous design (known as yloop), Developers can use a wide range of MCUs.

**FOTA**
With built-in FOTA capability, Developers do not need to worry about features upgrade any more.

**Modular**
With the modular and multiple binaries design, Developers can use AliOS features easily, meanwhile keep the application clean.

Now, let's get start to build the first [Hello World Example](https://github.com/alibaba/AliOS/wiki/AliOS-APP-DEV-Guide) for the ultimate experience with AliOS.
